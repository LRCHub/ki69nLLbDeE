We gets it poppin' on the late
Pop poppin' on the late night
Poppin' on the late
Pop poppin' on the late night
Poppin' on the late
Pop poppin' on the late
Pop poppin' on the
Pop poppin' on the
Back backpack full of goodies
Backback full of good
Backpack full of goodies
Backback full of good
Backpack full of goodies
Backback full of good
Pop poppin' on the late night
Poppin' on the late night

Look, we gets it poppin' on the late night
Rockin' til the day
You be in the corner just talking to some lames
Watch me as I take flight, hoppin' on a plane
I'll be going through the song
Drop, drop and go away
Drop and go away? (go away?)
Bring it right back
And imma fight that man in the tight slacks
He need a ice pack, he need his life back
All up in his grill like rat a tat tat
